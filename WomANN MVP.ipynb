Coupled with the often male-dominated research sphere, which may not fully understand or take into account the unique health experiences of women, it can lead to lower participation in research studies. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Additionally, research in women's health often lacks sufficient diversity. Studies historically have tended to focus on white, middle-class women, neglecting women of color, women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and women from various cultural backgrounds. This lack of inclusivity reduces the generalizability of research findings and exacerbates health disparities.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Lastly, research often fails to take into account the full breadth of women's health, focusing primarily on reproductive health and neglecting areas like mental health, chronic disease, and the effects of aging. This approach oversimplifies women's health, overlooking its complexity and the interplay of various physiological, mental, and social factors.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Altogether, these issues create a significant challenge for women's health research, with serious implications for the health and wellbeing of women worldwide. It's clear that a solution is urgently needed - one that addresses these barriers and opens new avenues for gathering data and enhancing our understanding of women's health."
